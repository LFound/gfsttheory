# Gravitational Field State Theory (GFST)

Gravitational Field State Theory (GFST) proposes that gravity is not simply an effect of empty space bending around mass but emerges from an elastic field resisting compression. In this view, matter creates tension gradients that guide motion and shape structure across all scales.

GFST also suggests that the early universe formed as an elastic field attempting to stabilise into a sphere, where perfect closure was mathematically impossible. The residual tension from that imperfect geometry seeded the distribution of matter we observe today.
