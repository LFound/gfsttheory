    <h1>Gravitational Field State Theory</h1>
    <p><strong>Independent publication (2025)</strong></p>

    <p>
  Gravitational Field State Theory (GFST) began with a simple question:
</p>

<blockquote>
  What if gravity is not an invisible force pulling across empty space but the natural resistance of something real and elastic
</blockquote>

<p>
  In this framework space is not an empty backdrop. It is a continuous elastic field extending through all scales. When mass appears it compresses this field creating gradients of tension. Objects respond to these gradients by following the paths where resistance changes rather than being pulled by attraction alone.
</p>
<p>
  Picture trying to wrap a flat sheet of paper perfectly around a sphere. However carefully you smooth it you will always find small creases and distortions. This happens because Ï€ makes flawless closure impossible. GFST suggests the early universe formed in much the same way. An elastic field attempting to stabilise into a sphere could never resolve every inconsistency. The residual tension from that imperfect geometry shaped the structure of everything that followed.
</p>
<p>
  Over time this idea has developed into a broader framework. Black holes can be viewed as regions where the field reaches complete saturation rather than singularities. The familiar effects of gravity emerge from an elastic medium, continuously adjusting and storing compression. Even the quiet background of space may carry subtle patterns that reflect this original imperfect closure.
</p>
<p>
  GFST does not aim to replace established physics but to offer a complementary perspective. Instead of relying only on abstract curvature or distant forces this approach proposes the universe as an elastic lattice with properties that can be described explored and perhaps measured in new ways.
